## 🔬 Traditional Analysis Strategies Implemented & Tested

### 1. **Statistical Analysis** (`test_statistical_analysis.py`)
- **Event Statistics**: Categorization and counting of news events by impact level
- **Delay Statistics**: Calculation of delay percentages and average delay days
- **Risk Score Calculation**: Multi-metric statistical risk assessment
- **Empty Data Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or insufficient data

**Key Metrics Tested**:
- Delay percentage calculation
- High-impact event counting
- Average delay days computation
- Risk score derivation from combined statistics

### 2. **Threshold Analysis** (`test_threshold_analysis.py`)
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Risk level classification based on predefined thresholds
- **Multi-Metric Assessment**: Combination of delay and event-based thresholds
- **Boundary Testing**: Validation of exact threshold boundary conditions
- **Risk Level Combination**: Merging multiple risk assessments

**Threshold Categories**:
- Delay Percentage: Low (<10%), Medium (10-25%), High (25-50%), Critical (>50%)
- High-Impact Events: Low (<2), Medium (2-5), High (5-10), Critical (>10)
- Average Delay Days: Low (<3), Medium (3-7), High (7-14), Critical (>14)

### 3. **Keyword Matching** (`test_keyword_matching.py`)
- **Weighted Keywords**: Different risk weights for keyword categories
- **Multi-Category Analysis**: Political, logistics, tariff, and schedule keywords
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Robust text processing capabilities
- **Risk Aggregation**: Combination of keyword matches into comprehensive risk scores

**Keyword Categories Tested**:
- **Political**: war, conflict, sanctions, election, government, policy
- **Logistics**: blockade, strike, congestion, delay, port, shipping
- **Tariff**: trade war, embargo, tariff, duty, customs, quota
- **Schedule**: cancelled, delayed, postponed, schedule, timeline

### 4. **Trade Route Analysis** (`test_trade_route_analysis.py`)
- **Country Risk Scores**: Predefined risk assessments for different countries
- **Route Complexity**: Factoring in transit countries and route complexity
- **Alternative Route Identification**: Suggestion of lower-risk alternatives
- **Equipment-Route Mapping**: Analysis of risks for specific equipment routes

**Country Risk Examples**:
- Low Risk: United States (20), Germany (15), Japan (18)
- Medium Risk: China (45), India (50)
- High Risk: Russia (70), Iran (85), North Korea (95)

### 5. **Time Window Analysis** (`test_time_window_analysis.py`)
- **Multiple Time Windows**: Immediate (1 day), short-term (7 days), medium-term (30 days), long-term (90 days)
- **Risk Decay Factors**: Reduction of impact for older events
- **Trend Analysis**: Identification of increasing/decreasing risk trends
- **Schedule Timeline Analysis**: Analysis of upcoming delivery schedules

**Time Window Impact Factors**:
- Immediate: 1.0 (full impact)
- Short-term: 0.8 (80% impact)
- Medium-term: 0.5 (50% impact)
- Long-term: 0.2 (20% impact)

## 🤖 AI Analysis Strategies Implemented & Tested

### AI Strategy Testing (`test_ai_strategies.py`)
- **AI Service Integration**: Testing of OpenRouter API integration
- **Multiple Analysis Types**: Schedule, political, and comprehensive analysis
- **AI vs Traditional Comparison**: Direct methodology comparison
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when AI service is unavailable
- **Mock Testing**: Testing with simulated AI responses

**AI Analysis Types**:
1. **Scheduler Analysis**: AI-powered schedule risk assessment
2. **Political Analysis**: AI-powered geopolitical risk analysis
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Multi-dimensional AI risk analysis
